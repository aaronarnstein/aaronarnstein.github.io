                    From the outside, it seemed as if Taylor Ligouri had the self-described “perfect” life. She was
                    surrounded by a supportive and loving family, loyal friends and was playing softball at her dream
                    school, the University of Maryland. </p>

                <p> But on the inside, things were much different. </p>

                <p> She was battling raging depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and anxiety. </p>

                <p> “I really fell into a dark place,” she said. “I was struggling and yet no one knew I was.” </p>

                <p>Ligouri is one of thousands of student-athletes each year who experience mental health struggles,
                    which are particularly prevalent among collegiate student-athletes. According to the <a
                        href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-csmr/fulltext/2015/01000/depression_in_athletes__prevalence_and_risk.17.aspx#O6-17-4">American
                        College of Sports Medicine</a>, depression affects about 7% of today’s adult population but
                    ranges from 15 to 21% among collegiate student-athletes.</p>

                <p> Senior Lecturer Dr. Elizabeth Brown has taught at the University of Maryland for over four decades.
                    Her expertise is in both sports psychology and educational psychology while her focus includes the
                    pressures children face in youth sport. </p>

                <p> She says the potential of being sidelined due to injury is one of the primary reasons college
                    athletes struggle with their mental health. </p>

                <p>“Every day they go to practice and they see athletic trainers working on injured athletes and it’s a
                    reminder that this could be you,” she said. “Will someone come along and replace you at your
                    position [if you are injured]?" </p>

                <p>Injuries contributed to Ligouri’s mental health decline. In a <a
                        href="https://umterps.com/news/2022/5/6/softball-in-her-own-words-taylor-liguori-mental-health-is-health.aspx">first-person
                        essay</a> in which she disclosed her struggles with mental health, Ligouri said she felt as if
                    “my life was crumbling in front of my eyes” after she underwent surgery and was sidelined from
                    softball.</p>

                            alt="Mental health concerns chart" class="img-fluid" />

                    </p>
                    <p>When discussing the mental health hurdles many student-athletes face, It is important to
                        distinguish the rigorous schedule of collegiate athletes compared to that of a regular college
                        student. Whether it’s the offseason or in-season, the physical and mental responsibilities are
                        extremely taxing.</p>

                    <p>“We have morning workouts where we have to wake up early, afternoon homework and pushing through
                        the exhaustion and figuring out how to get everything done and managing your time well,”
                        University of Maryland softball player Trinity Schlotterbeck said. “It’s figuring out how to
                        balance everything and then pushing through those mental pressures, playing, doing well at
                        practices and trying to go home and balance that school life.”</p>

                    <p> The onset of COVID-19 made matters worse. </p>

                    <p>Ligouri described it as “probably the worst thing that could have ever happened to me,” she
                        wrote. The then-freshman was stuck at home, away from friends and stripped of the game she
                        loved, softball. “I was at home the entire time, being in my room…which isn’t the most ideal
                        thing to do, especially for someone as active as a student athlete,” she said.</p>

                    <p>Ligouri was not alone. A November and December 2021 NCAA <a
                            href="https://ncaaorg.s3.amazonaws.com/research/other/2020/2022RES_NCAA-SA-Well-BeingSurveyPPT.pdf">survey</a>
                        of nearly 10,000 student-athletes across all collegiate levels showed that rates of reported
                        mental health concerns were 1 1/2 to two times higher than prior to 2020. </p>

                        </div>

                        <p>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        </p>
                        <p> Collegiate athletic departments’ lack of mental health resources also plays a role in the
                            student-athlete mental health crisis and furthers the long-standing stigma to not seek help.
                        </p>

                        <p>Fewer than half of students surveyed by the NCAA felt they would be comfortable personally
                            seeking support from a mental health provider on campus while only about 50% of athletes
                            reported that coaches take mental health concerns of their student-athletes seriously. </p>

                            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                                <p>“I really fell into a dark place,” she said. “I was struggling and yet no one knew I was.”</p>
                            </blockquote>
                        

                        <p>“When I first came here [University of Maryland] and for decades there was no sports
                            psychologist hired by the athletic department. Still, there are a lot of coaches who don’t
                            really value certain psychology,” Brown said. “There’s a stigma many times attached to an
                            athlete who searches out a sports psychologist and they’re afraid of what the coach and
                            other players might think.” </p>

                    </div>
<p></p>
                    <div class="header-one">
                    Headed in the right direction
                    </div>
                    
                

                    <p> With the increased attention towards sports psychology, more students are going into the field.
                        This has helped athletes become more comfortable in seeing sports psychologists, Brown said.
                    </p>

                    <p>She identified two factors that can improve the mental health situation in college athletics.
                        Spectators must avoid glorifying the athletes and expect them to be perfect. “We can’t put them
                        on a perfectionistic pedestal. They’re going to have problems and we have to recognize that,”
                        she said. “That doesn’t take away from their athletic ability.” </p>

                    <p>Brown puts the responsibility of improving athletes’ mental health on athletic departments. “They
                        have to be aware that these kids are struggling. It has to come from the top,” she said. “From
                        the university to the athletic director to the coaches to everybody else who supports a
                        student-athlete.”</p>

                        <p>After complaints over the NCAA’s lack of action toward improving student athletes’ mental health, the NCAA stepped up its efforts in recent years.</p>

                    <p>Take the University of Maryland, for example. Maryland softball
                        coach Mark Montgomery is a strong proponent of ensuring his players are in the right frame of
                        mind. “The first part is making sure they don't define themselves by their sport. It’s part of
                        what they do but not who they are,” Montgomery said.</p>

                    <p>“If you have a bad day at the office, strike out a few times, make an error or two, it doesn't
                        mean we don't love you, it doesn't mean we don't care. It doesn’t mean if we don't play you the
                        next game it's because you are a bad person.”</p>

                    <p>As for Ligouri, she sought help and climbed out of the self-described “darkest moments of my
                        life.” She advocates for others struggling with their mental health to do the same.</p>

                    <p> “I went to go see a therapist, I talked to friends, I went on medication,” the senior said. </p>

                    <p> “Things that most people don't want to talk about, talking about it is the only way to get
                        people to do it.” </p>

                        <p>
                        </p>
                        <p>

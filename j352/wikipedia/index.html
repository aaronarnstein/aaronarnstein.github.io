        <h1>Life Summary</h1>
        <b>Shinzo Abe</b> (/ˈʃɪnzoʊ ˈɑːbeɪ/ SHIN-zoh AH-bay; Japanese: 安倍 晋三, Hepburn: Abe Shinzō, IPA: [abe ɕindzoː];
        21 September 1954 – 8 July 2022) was a Japanese politician who served as Prime Minister of Japan and President
        of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) from 2006 to 2007 and again from 2012 to 2020. He was the longest-serving
        prime minister in Japanese history. Abe also served as Chief Cabinet Secretary from 2005 to 2006 under Junichiro
        Koizumi and was briefly the opposition leader in 2012.

            <h2>Early life</h2>
            <b>
                <h3>Family</h3>
            </b>
            <p>Shinzo Abe was born on 21 September 1954 to a prominent political family in Shinjuku, Tokyo.[22] Although
                as a boy he aspired to become a filmmaker, Abe's family history led him upon a political path.[23] His
                father Shintaro Abe served in the House of Representatives from 1958 to 1991, with stints as Chief
                Cabinet Secretary, Minister for International Trade and Industry, and Minister for Foreign Affairs.
                During World War II, Shintaro volunteered to be a kamikaze pilot but the war ended before he completed
                training.[24]</p>
            <p>Abe's maternal grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, was the de facto "economic king" of occupied China and
                Manchukuo, a Japanese puppet state in Northern China established after the Japanese invasion of
                Manchuria in the lead-up to the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II.[25][26] During the war, Kishi
                served as Vice Minister of Munitions in the cabinet of Prime Minister Hideki Tojo.[27] At the end of the
                war, Kishi was imprisoned as a suspected "Class-A" war criminal by the US military occupation of Japan,
                but was released and later de-purged as part of the Occupation's "reverse course" due to the Cold
                War.[27] Kishi helped found the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in 1955 and served as Prime Minister of
                Japan from 1957 until his 1960 resignation following the Anpo protests.[28][29] The BBC speculated that
                Abe's aversion to protests may have originated as a result.[30] Abe viewed Kishi as his "No 1 role
                model" and was influenced by many of his beliefs, like Kishi's hawkish stance on Communist
                China.[30][31] Regarding Kishi, Abe later wrote: "Some people used to point to my grandfather as a
                'Class-A war criminal suspect,' and I felt strong repulsion. Because of that experience, I may have
                become emotionally attached to 'conservatism,' on the contrary".[31]</p>
            <p>Abe's paternal grandfather, Kan Abe, was a Yamaguchi landowner who served in the House of Representatives
                during World War II. In contrast to Kishi, Kan Abe was a stalwart pacifist who opposed the Tojo
                government and war in East Asia.[32]</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Member of the House of Representatives</h2>
        <p>Abe was elected to the first district of Yamaguchi Prefecture [ja] in 1993 after his father's 1991 death,
            winning the most votes of the four Representatives elected in the SNTV multi-member district. In 1999, he
            became Director of the Social Affairs Division. He was Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary in the Yoshirō Mori
            and Junichiro Koizumi Cabinets from 2000 to 2003, after which he was appointed Secretary-General of the
            Liberal Democratic Party.</p>
        <p>Abe was a member of the Mori Faction (formally, the Seiwa Seisaku Kenkyū-kai) of the Liberal Democratic
            Party.[41] This faction is headed by former prime minister Yoshirō Mori. Junichiro Koizumi was a member of
            the Mori Faction, but left it, as is the custom when accepting a high party post. From 1986 to 1991, Abe's
            father, Shintaro, headed the same faction.</p>
        <p>On 23 April 2006, Abe was elected as the president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.[45] His chief
            competitors for the position were Sadakazu Tanigaki and Tarō Asō. Yasuo Fukuda was a leading early contender
            but ultimately chose not to run. Former prime minister Yoshirō Mori, to whose faction both Abe and Fukuda
            belonged, stated that the faction strongly leant toward Abe.[46]</p>

        <h2>First term as prime minister (2006-2007)</h2>
        <b>
            <h3>Inaguration and cabinet</h3>
        </b>
        <p>[edit]

            Abe (pictured in 2006) was the youngest prime minister since Fumimaro Konoe in 1941
            On 26 September 2006, Abe was inaugurated as Japanese prime minister.[47] Elected at age 52, he was the
            youngest prime minister since Fumimaro Konoe in 1941.[48] He was also the first prime minister born after
            World War II.[49] Abe's first cabinet was announced on 26 September 2006. The only minister retained in his
            position from the previous Koizumi cabinet was Foreign Minister Tarō Asō, who had been one of Abe's
            competitors for the LDP presidency. In addition to the cabinet positions existing under Koizumi, Abe created
            five new "advisor" positions. He reshuffled his cabinet on 27 August 2007.[50] Commentators noted that these
            changes seemed to effort by Abe to organize the Prime Minister's office into something more akin to the
            White House.[51]</p>
        <b>
            <h3>Domestic policy</h3>
        </b>
        <p>Abe expressed a general commitment to the reforms instituted by his predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi.[48] He
            took some steps toward balancing the Japanese budget, such as appointing a tax policy expert, Kōji Omi, as
            Minister of Finance. Omi previously supported increases in the national consumption tax, although Abe
            distanced himself from this policy and sought to achieve much of his budget-balancing through spending
            cuts.[52]</p>

        <p>Since 1997, as the bureau chief of the "Institute of Junior Assembly Members Who Think About the Outlook of
            Japan and History Education", Abe supported the controversial Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform
            and the New History Textbook.[53] In March 2007, Abe, along with right-wing politicians, proposed a bill to
            encourage nationalism and a "love for one's country and hometown" among the Japanese youth (specific wording
            from the revised "Fundamental Law of Education" 教育基本法, which was revised to include "love of country").[54]
        </p>

        <b>
            <h2>Resignation</h2>
        </b>
        <p>n the leadup to the July election, Abe's Agriculture Minister Toshikatsu Matsuoka committed suicide following
            a series of political funding scandals. He was the first cabinet member to commit suicide since World War
            II.[70] Abe's ruling Liberal Democratic Party suffered great losses in the upper house election, losing
            control for the first time in 52 years. Agricultural minister, Norihiko Akagi, involved in a political
            funding scandal, resigned after the election. Additionally, Abe's rejection of a possible female Japanese
            monarch, which led to the Japanese succession controversy, diminished[citation needed] his support base.[71]
        </p>

        <h2>Personal Life</h2>
        <p>Abe married Akie Matsuzaki, a socialite and former radio disc jockey, in 1987. She is the daughter of the
            president of Morinaga, a confectionery manufacturer. She is popularly known as the "domestic opposition
            party" due to her outspoken views, which often contradicted her husband's.[355] Following her husband's
            first stint as prime minister, she opened an organic izakaya in the Kanda district of Tokyo, but remained
            inactive in management due to the urging of her mother-in-law.[355] The couple had no children, having
            undergone unsuccessful fertility treatments early in their marriage.[356] Abe's elder brother, Hironobu Abe,
            became president and CEO of Mitsubishi Shōji Packaging Corporation, while his younger brother, Nobuo Kishi,
            became Senior Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>
